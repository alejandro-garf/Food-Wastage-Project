// and returns CROW framework compatible objects. So when you are implementing
// your own classes to represent concepts like food wastage record and food
// wastage report etc, you'll have to comvert those objects to/from CROW
// objects. Some helper functions have been provided in
// food_wastage_tracker_backend.cc to help you with that conversion.
